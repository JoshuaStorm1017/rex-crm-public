Hid Edit and Delete on the five record pages, and stopped the edit URL
from rendering a form the domain will refuse. Complete and Reopen,
including the related list, follow task edit. The previous sessions
that tried organization-wide defaults and a product catalog were
abandoned after three review rounds, so this stayed on the one
permission hole the handoff already named.

An owner who can edit but not delete sees Edit and Save, and not
Delete. The inverse sees Delete and the edit-page denial. A non-owner
sees neither. Modify-all follows the profile flag on someone else's
record. Other objects carry the opposite flags, so checking the wrong
object fails. Thirteen mutations failed the new tests and were restored.

`npm run verify` exited 0 at 22:05 EDT: 36 files, 402 tests, Next.js
16.3.5 build. Throwaway HTML at port 3021: Riley's Wile page listed
Ship extra helmet with no Edit, Delete, or Complete, and the edit URL
showed the denial. Riley's own contact showed Edit, Delete, and Save.
The operator saw Edit, Delete, and Complete on Wile and on Acme. The
server was stopped. No browser pass. Chrome DevTools was not connected.

Next: Change Owner. Then cascade task deletes, which still skip the
task owner. Convert and the New record links are still shown when the
domain may refuse them. Do not retry the whole sharing model or the
product catalog in one change.

Locked the three authorization mutations that survived the last pass.
The checks were already right. The tests granted the same delete flag
on every object, and the opportunity page only compared someone who
can edit and delete with someone who can do neither.

Recycle now has an owner and a modify-all user who can delete accounts
and cannot delete opportunities: the account is listed and restored,
the opportunity stays hidden, and `undeleteRecord` returns `FORBIDDEN`
with the row still deleted. The inverse profile, for an owner and for
modify-all, lists and restores the opportunity and leaves the account
deleted. The opportunity page renders a delete-not-edit owner (denial
copy only) and an edit-not-delete owner (Make primary, Remove, and
Add role).

`npm run verify` exited 0 at 16:35 EDT: 35 files, 394 tests, Next.js
16.3.5 build. Each of the three survivors was re-applied, failed the
new test, and was restored before that run. The other recycle tests
and the older page render still passed under those mutations. No
browser pass. Chrome DevTools was not connected.

Next: Change Owner, then hide Edit and Delete wherever the domain will
refuse the save, including the edit page. Cascade task deletes still
skip the task owner. Do not retry the whole sharing model or the
product catalog in one change.

Closed the four mutation survivors from the undelete and opportunity
contact-role review. The enforcement was already right. The tests were
not.

Recycle now proves an edit-but-not-delete owner cannot see or restore a
deleted account, contact, lead, opportunity, or task. Role update
succeeds for an edit-not-delete owner and throws `FORBIDDEN` for a
delete-not-edit owner, leaving the role and primary flag unchanged.
That deleter's contact delete still clears the junction rows. The
opportunity page renders Make primary, Remove, and Add role only when
the actor can edit the opportunity.

test, and was restored before that run. No browser pass. Chrome
DevTools was not connected.

refuse the save, including the edit page. Cascade task deletes still

Gated recycle restore and opportunity contact roles. The two previous
sessions tried organization-wide defaults and then a product catalog.
Each was abandoned after three review rounds, so this session took one
permission hole from `HANDOFF.md` and closed it.

Undelete now uses the same delete rule as a live record: profile delete,
plus owner or modify-all. The recycle list uses that check too. A
contact role create, update, or delete requires edit on the live
opportunity, including the role lead convert inserts. If that edit is
denied, convert rolls back. Deleting the parent opportunity or contact
still clears the junction rows without the edit check.

`npm run verify` exited 0 at 15:32 EDT: 34 files, 391 tests, Next.js
16.3.5 build. Nine focused mutations each failed and were restored
before that run. Authenticated HTML on a throwaway database at port
3019 showed Riley blocked on the operator's opportunity and an empty
recycle bin, and showed the operator the Undelete button. The dev
server was stopped. Chrome DevTools was not connected, so there was no
viewport pass.

Next: Change Owner, then hide Edit and Delete wherever the domain will
refuse the save, including the edit page. Cascade task deletes still
skip the task owner. Do not retry the whole sharing model or the
product catalog in one change.
